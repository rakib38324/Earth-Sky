# Highlight Feature:
The key feature of Earth Skybridge is its ability to unify, streamline, and enhance accessibility to critical Earth data observed from space through the advanced VISIONS tool. This empowers innovative interdisciplinary scientific research and promotes a deeper understanding of our planet's dynamics and changes.

### 1. Unified Data Integration: 
Seamlessly collect data from all Earth-observing platforms aboard the ISS into VISIONS. A robust backend system for automated data harmonization, ensuring all datasets align in terms of metrics, dimensions, and standards.

### 2. AI-Driven Analysis Engine: 
Tailored algorithms for specific data types: atmosphere, oceans, and land. Predictive models for forecasting key environmental events, anomalies, or shifts.

### 3. Interactive Earth Dashboard: 
A visually rich UI showcasing real-time Earth observations. Modules that allow users to dive deep into specific environmental phenomena or regions.

### 4. "Earth From Above" Community Portal:
Virtual tours of observed regions, driven by real-time data. Educational resources and modules suitable for schools, colleges, and enthusiasts.
